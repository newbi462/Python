# Python

As I get back to looking for my next main contract or job I am hitting the "can you show a portfolio of work" wall, which for a developer that has done more freelance work where the code is not always Open Source or up here on GitHub under my handle can be problematic. Not all projects are visual enough to make a good web site portfolio piece, and when someone contracts or employees me to be a dev it is not my design skills they seek but my code and problem-solving skills.

Fortunately, there are so many code challenge sites today, so I am just dumping my [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) keep me sharp practice in a repo like this one. In this case, this one is for the ones I do in Python.

While arbitrary problems, they can at least give you a feel for my method and code practices, as well as documentation standards.
